# Introduction

In 2018, there were 57,000 firearms related incidents and/or deaths in the USA according to [GVA](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/).
According to [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/?utm_term=.2e83c51a0b18) 
there are 120 guns per 100 US citizen. 


### Motivation
Regardless of the age-long debate on legalizing firearms, 
 another way to decrease firearm-related violence is through holding manufacturers and owners accountable for their firearms. 
 Using Ethereum Blockchain and smart contracts to tokenize these firearms from the time they are manufactured to the time it is with the owners.
